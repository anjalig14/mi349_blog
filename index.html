<p> Hello everyone! Today, I wanted to talk about a few topics related to personal growth and development and information in general.<br> 
    There will be two points that I wish to share.</p>

<p><img src="Produce.png" alt="The Importance of Food"></p>

<p> The first being: "The importance of food."<br>
    A widely stressed upon topic that is arrising is the importance of food. Quoted from Vandana Shiva, an Indian scholar, environmental activist, food 
    sovereignty advocate, ecofeminist and anti-globalisation, quoted that "Food is a weapon". This is based on her reasoning that<br>
    when you control weapons, you control armies. And when you control food, you control society. But when you control seed<br>
    you control life on earth. I think that this is a very important concern that should spark many people's attention.<br>
    Whether we are aware of it or not, it is widely noticeable how much control the government and other industries have on<br> 
    the food industry. The chemicals and pesticides used to make our source of fuel have immensely impacted our health which has<br>
    possitively contributed towards the revenue in the pharmaceutical industry. It is being assumed that the pharmaceutical industry<br>
    and medical industry aim is to not cure our issues but temper them through drugs by making us come back again when issues arise.<br>
    A big contribution to a high amount of ill health is the food and products that we consume. That is why it is important to<br>
    understand where our food comes from and how it is harvested.</p>

<p><img src="The Art of Reading.png" alt="The Art of Reading"></p>

<p> The second being: The importance of reading.<br>
    Our brains are very malleable. Therefore, it is very important to be able to differentiate right from wrong.<br>
    In order to be able to build our intellegence and ability to decipher, we should make an effort to research 
    and broaden our knowledge and persepctive about certain issues and topics. To do this, books will become your<br>
    best friend. It is essential to invest time into reading. No matter what  topic you wish to learn more about<br>
    whether it be finance, health, spirituality, self growth, books are your way there. There are many secrets and<br>
    useful points held in books that are not talked about. Reading not only heightens your knowledge, but it can improve
    your communication skills, focus, and memory. It is important to stretch the flexibility of our mind. Due to short<br>
    videos that we see on social media platforms, our attention span and retention ability has weakened contributing to<br>
    our lack of focus. Not only that but we live in a very intergrated society. More than ever. Through books written<br>
    by authors from different time periods and places, there is most likely one person who has gone through the same<br>
    experiences as you. And by reading those books, you can seek them for the answers to your questions. </p>
