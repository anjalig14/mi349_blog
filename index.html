<h1 id ="hello" class="section-heading">The Importance Of...</h1>

<p> Hello everyone! Today, I wanted to talk about a few topics related to personal growth and development and information in general.<br> 
    There will be two points that I wish to share.</p>

<p><img src="Produce.jpeg" alt="The Importance of Food"></p>

<p> The first being: The Importance of Food.<br>
    A widely stressed upon topic that is arrising is the importance of food. Quoted from Vandana Shiva, an Indian<br> 
    scholar, environmental activist, food sovereignty advocate, ecofeminist and anti-globalisation, quoted that<br> 
    "Food is a weapon". This is based on her reasoning that when you control weapons, you control armies. And when<br>
    you control food, you control society. But when you control seed you control life on earth. I think that this<br> 
    is a very important concern that should spark many people's attention. Whether we are aware of it or not, it<br> 
    is widely noticeable how much control the government and other industries have on the food industry. The chemicals<br>
    and pesticides used to make our source of fuel have immensely impacted our health which has possitively contributed<br>
    towards the revenue in the pharmaceutical industry. It is being assumed that the pharmaceutical industry and medical<br>
    industry aim is to not cure our issues but temper them through drugs by making us come back again when issues arise.<br> 
    A big contribution to a high amount of ill health is the food and products that we consume. That is why it is<br>
    important to understand where our food comes from and how it is harvested.</p>

<p> The second being: The Importance of Reading.<br>
    Our brains are very malleable. Therefore, it is very important to be able to differentiate right from wrong.<br>
    In order to be able to build our intellegence and ability to decipher, we should make an effort to research<br> 
    and broaden our knowledge and persepctive about certain issues and topics. To do this, books will become your<br>
    best friend. It is essential to invest time into reading. No matter what  topic you wish to learn more about<br>
    whether it be finance, health, spirituality, self growth, books are your way there. There are many secrets and<br>
    useful points held in books that are not talked about. Reading not only heightens your knowledge, but it can improve<br>
    your communication skills, focus, and memory. It is important to stretch the flexibility of our mind. Due to short<br>
    videos that we see on social media platforms, our attention span and retention ability has weakened contributing to<br>
    our lack of focus. Not only that but we live in a very intergrated society. More than ever. Through books written<br>
    by authors from different time periods and places, there is most likely one person who has gone through the same<br>
    experiences as you. And by reading those books, you can seek them for the answers to your questions.</p>
