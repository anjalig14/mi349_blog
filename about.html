        <p> Hello everyone. My name is Anjali. I am a junior majoring in Information Science<br> 
            here at MSU. During my free time I enjoy expanding my knowledge, baking, gardening,<br>  
            and taking walks around campus. I also enjoy spending time alone whenever I can and<br> 
            find it to be most peaceful. The MSU campus is beautiful wherever you go so I have<br>  
            been taking strolls whenever I have the time.</p>

        <p> I also enjoy learning about topics related to finance and business,personal<br>  
            growth and development, health and even philosophies. A generally wide range<br> 
            of topics! Especially during the start of COVID I have been able to grow my<br> 
            knowledge on many interesting topics thanks to the help of individuals online.<br>  
            Through this blog, I hope to share the same interests with you as well!</p>
